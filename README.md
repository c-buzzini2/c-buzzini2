# Hello, I'm Claudia! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Rank 2 student at 42 Lisbon, and this is the very beginning of my path as software engineer.

## âš¡ Note
- I'm uploading my code exactly as I wrote them, with the knowledge that I had at the time. This means that whenever I learned a new, better way to write something, I used it from then on. I didn't go back to improve my very first line of code because I wanted to be able to see my own progress and understand how I approached the problems when they were completely new to me. They are all my own solutions. I hope it is as fun to you as it is to me!
